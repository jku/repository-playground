# Repository Playground

This project is a place to develop workflows and Best Practices for community artifact repositories (like PyPI or npm). To accomplish that we intend to implement a community content repository of our own: A service that resembles "real" content repositories like PyPI but is able to experiment more freely.

The first goal is to define and implement a working TUF model for community artifact repositories.

More details in documentation:
 * [Concept](docs/CONCEPT.md)
 * [TUF Design Questions](docs/TUF-DESIGN-QUESTIONS.md): What are some of unexplored issues with TUF in the community artifact repository use case
 * [TUF Design Notes](docs/DESIGN-NOTES.md): Some very early design discussion on what to build
