# repository-playground

This project is a place to develop workflows and Best Practices for community artifact repositories (like PyPI or npm). To accomplish that we intend to implement a community content repository of our own: A service that resembles "real" content repositories like PyPI but is able to experiment more freely.

The first goal is to define and implement a working TUF model for community artifact repositories.
